A recreation of my own C I/O library called "stdiox.h" for my CS 392 Systems Programming Class. 
Our new library should provides the following utilities:
▶ Write integers/strings to and read integers/strings from a file;
▶ Print integers/strings to terminal;
▶ Receive user input as integers/strings from keyboard.
